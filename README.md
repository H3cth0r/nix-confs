# My NixConfigurations

Howdy y'all! This is my nixos configuration.

## Setup
1. Navigate to `/etc/nixos`.
2. Wget the `configuration.nix` and `flake.nix` to this directory.  You can also directly clone this into any directory.
3. Rebuild Nixos: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos`. You can change the path to were `configuration` or `flake` is located.

sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos


Set the flake in /etc/nixos
